## Bugfixes for SFAR's Thoracoscore calculator

### tl;dr

The [Société Française d’Anesthésie et de Réanimation][1] provides Google's [top-ranked result][2] for a [Thoracoscore][3] calculator. [Their Thorascore calculator][4] has a systematic error that introduces an addition of 0.05% to all scores that it calculates. We provide a patched version of their calculator's Javascript that corrects this error. We presented our findings at the Society for Cardiothoracic Surgery for Great Britain & Ireland's [2012 Annual Meeting][5].

### The Error

SFAR's Thoracoscore calculator uses the [following function][11] to attempt to round the calculated score (`x`) to 2 decimal places:
	
```javascript
	function Fmt(x) {
		var v
		if (x >= 0) {
			v = '' + (x + 0.05)
		} else {
			v = '' + (x - 0.05)
		}
		return v.substring(0,v.indexOf('.')+3)
	}
```

As `x` is always ≥0, this adds 0.05 to `x` before the `substring` method truncates the string to 2 decimal places.  This does not round to 2 decimal places.  What was perhaps meant was to add 0.005 before truncating to 2 decimal places; this would be a valid rounding function.

We suggest the alternative:

```javascript
	function Fmt(x) {
		return Math.round(x * 100) / 100;
	}
```
